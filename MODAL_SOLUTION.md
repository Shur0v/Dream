# Global Modal State Management Solution

## Problem
The sign in/signup modal was not working globally across different routes. When users clicked the sign in button from different pages, the modal wouldn't appear because each page had its own local modal state that wasn't shared.

## Root Cause
The issue was that each `MainLayout` component instance managed its own local modal state using `useState`. When navigating between routes (e.g., from `/client` to `/client/categories`), each page created a new `MainLayout` instance with fresh modal state, causing the modal to not persist across route changes.

## Solution
Implemented a global modal state management system using React Context API:

### 1. Created ModalContext (`src/contexts/ModalContext.tsx`)
- **ModalProvider**: Provides global modal state and actions
- **useModal**: Custom hook to access modal context
- **Global State**: Manages `isLoginModalOpen`, `isRegisterModalOpen`, and `currentUserType`
- **Global Actions**: Provides functions to open/close modals and switch user types

### 2. Updated MainLayout (`src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`)
- Removed local modal state management
- Now uses global modal context via `useModal()` hook
- All modal callbacks now use global functions

### 3. Wrapped App with Provider (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added `ModalProvider` to the root layout
- Ensures modal state is available throughout the entire application

### 4. Added Test Component (`src/components/test/ModalTestComponent.tsx`)
- Created a test component to verify modal functionality
- Shows current modal state and provides buttons to test different scenarios
- Added to both `/client` and `/client/categories` pages for testing

## Key Benefits
1. **Global State**: Modal state persists across all routes
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Sign in/signup buttons work the same way everywhere
3. **Centralized Management**: All modal logic is in one place
4. **Easy Testing**: Test component allows verification of functionality
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more global modal functionality

## How It Works
1. User clicks sign in button on any page
2. `MainHeader` calls `onOpenLoginModal` prop
3. This triggers the global `openLoginModal` function from context
4. Modal state updates globally
5. Modal appears regardless of which page the user is on
6. State persists when navigating between routes

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/ModalContext.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` (updated)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (updated)
- `src/components/test/ModalTestComponent.tsx` (new)
- `src/app/client/page.tsx` (updated for testing)
- `src/app/client/categories/page.tsx` (updated for testing)

## Testing
The solution includes a test component that:
- Shows current modal state
- Provides buttons to open different types of modals
- Allows testing across different routes
- Can be removed in production

## Usage
The modal system now works globally. Users can:
1. Click sign in button from any page
2. Navigate to different routes while modal is open
3. Modal state persists across navigation
4. All modal functionality works consistently everywhere

## Next Steps
1. Remove test components before production
2. Add error handling for modal operations
3. Consider adding modal state persistence to localStorage
4. Add analytics tracking for modal interactions
